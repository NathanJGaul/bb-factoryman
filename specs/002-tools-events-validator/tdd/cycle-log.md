# Cycle Log: Tools and approval, event wiring, and the validator

Append only.
Newest last.
Every entry's `red` block is the evidence that the test existed and failed before the implementation.

Batching rule: behaviors on one function or file share a cycle, as the cycle plan in `test-list.md` lists.
Each behavior in a batch still has its own test, and each entry records the failing output for each behavior id.

## Baseline

- suite: `pnpm test` -> 20 files, 354 passed, 0 failed
- commit: `2f108b0`
- recorded: cycle 0, before any feature change
